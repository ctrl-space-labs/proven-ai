# Blockchain Into

In the ProvenAI project, blockchain technology plays a crucial role in ensuring the security, transparency, and reliability of data management. ProvenAI is designed to handle data governance and provenance, which means keeping track of where data comes from and how it is used. Blockchain helps by providing a secure and tamper-proof way to store this information.

Blockchain is used in several key areas of the project. For example, it records proofs of data usage, which means every time data is accessed or used, a secure record is created and stored on the blockchain. This makes it easy to verify and track data interactions, ensuring that everything is transparent and accountable.

To ensure transparency while also protecting data privacy, ProvenAI uses Merkle trees to create a history of transactions. Only the Merkle root, a cryptographic summary of the entire transaction history, is saved on the blockchain. This approach reduces costs and ensures that no private data is exposed publicly.

By using blockchain, ProvenAI can provide a trustworthy system where data owners and AI developers know that their data is handled securely and fairly. Overall, blockchain technology is essential to making ProvenAI a secure and reliable tool for managing AI data.
